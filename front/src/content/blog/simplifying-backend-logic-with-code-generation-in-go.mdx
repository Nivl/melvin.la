Backend development often involves repetitive boilerplate code, especially when dealing with database queries and API server implementations. Writing and maintaining this code manually can be error-prone and time-consuming. Code generation (codegen) tools help automate these tasks by generating type-safe, efficient, and maintainable code from declarative specifications.

In this article, we'll explore how to simplify backend logic in Go by using two popular codegen tools:

- **[sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/)** for generating Go code from SQL queries
- **[oapi-codegen](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen)** for generating Go server code from OpenAPI specifications

## Why Use Code Generation?

- **Reduce boilerplate:** Automate repetitive code writing.
- **Increase type safety:** Avoid runtime errors by generating strongly typed code.
- **Improve maintainability:** Changes in SQL or API specs automatically propagate to code.
- **Boost productivity:** Focus on business logic rather than plumbing.


## SQL Code Generation with sqlc

### What is sqlc?

**sqlc** is a tool that generates Go code from SQL queries. You write your SQL queries in `.sql` files, and sqlc generates Go functions that execute those queries with type-safe parameters and results.

### How to Use sqlc

1. Write your SQL schema and queries.
2. Configure `sqlc.yaml` to specify input/output.
3. Run `sqlc generate` to produce Go code.

### Example

Suppose you have a simple `users` table:

```sql
-- schema.sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```

And a query to get a user by email:

```sql
-- queries.sql
-- name: GetUserByEmail :one
SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE email = $1;
```

Your `sqlc.yaml` config:

```yaml
version: "1"
packages:
  - name: "db"
    path: "./db"
    queries: "./queries.sql"
    schema: "./schema.sql"
    engine: "postgresql"
```

Run:

```bash
sqlc generate
```

This generates Go code with a method like:

```go
func (q *Queries) GetUserByEmail(ctx context.Context, email string) (User, error)
```

You can use it in your backend:

```go
user, err := dbQueries.GetUserByEmail(ctx, "alice@example.com")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
fmt.Println("User:", user.Name)
```

This eliminates manual SQL string handling and scanning rows, making your code cleaner and safer.

## Server Code Generation with oapi-codegen

### What is oapi-codegen?

**oapi-codegen** generates Go server (and client) code from an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification. It creates interfaces and request/response types, so you can focus on implementing business logic.

### How to Use oapi-codegen

1. Define your API in an OpenAPI YAML or JSON file.
2. Run `oapi-codegen` to generate Go server code.
3. Implement the generated interface methods.

### Example

Consider a simple OpenAPI spec `api.yaml`:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: User API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /users/{email}:
    get:
      summary: Get user by email
      parameters:
        - name: email
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: User found
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
        '404':
          description: User not found
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
        name:
          type: string
        email:
          type: string
```

Generate server code:

```bash
oapi-codegen -generate types,server -package api -o api.gen.go api.yaml
```

This generates:

- Go types for requests/responses (`User` struct)
- An interface `ServerInterface` with method:

```go
GetUsersEmail(ctx context.Context, email string) (api.User, error)
```

Implement the interface:

```go
type ServerImpl struct {
    db *db.Queries
}

func (s *ServerImpl) GetUsersEmail(ctx context.Context, email string) (api.User, error) {
    user, err := s.db.GetUserByEmail(ctx, email)
    if err != nil {
        return api.User{}, err
    }
    return api.User{
        Id:    int64(user.ID),
        Name:  user.Name,
        Email: user.Email,
    }, nil
}
```

Wire up the server:

```go
router := api.NewRouter(&ServerImpl{db: dbQueries})
http.ListenAndServe(":8080", router)
```


## Benefits of Combining sqlc and oapi-codegen

- **End-to-end type safety:** From database to API layer.
- **Clear separation:** SQL queries and API specs are declarative and separate from logic.
- **Faster development:** Focus on implementing business logic, not plumbing.
- **Easier refactoring:** Change SQL or API spec, regenerate code, and fix minimal code.


## Conclusion

Using **sqlc** and **oapi-codegen** together can greatly simplify backend development in Go by automating the generation of database access and API server code. This approach reduces boilerplate, improves safety, and accelerates development, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your application's core logic.
