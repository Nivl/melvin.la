Over the years, I've explored various programming languages and technologies. I enjoy learning new concepts and often spend my free time experimenting with emerging tools and frameworks. I am dedicated to clean architecture and well-tested code.",

I started with raw PHP when it was a leading technology for building websites, then embraced new trends such as Rails, Django, Symfony 2, Node, and Go. I strive to stay current with the evolution of backend technologies, carefully weighing their pros and cons before adopting them. Additionally, I have spent several years working with C and C++."

This reality sparked my interest in client-side development. I believe that writing client code has made me a better backend engineer, as I understand the challenges of working with undocumented or poorly designed APIs that only partially deliver the required data.",

It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine. — ",
