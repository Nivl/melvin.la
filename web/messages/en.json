Over the years, I've explored various programming languages and technologies. I enjoy learning new concepts and often spend my free time experimenting with emerging tools and frameworks. I am dedicated to clean architecture and well-tested code.",

        "content": "Like many web engineers from the pre-AngularJS era, I began my journey with backend development. I started with raw PHP when it was a leading technology for building websites, then embraced new trends such as Rails, Django, Symfony 2, Node, and Go. I strive to stay current with the evolution of backend technologies, carefully weighing their pros and cons before adopting them. Additionally, I have spent several years working with C and C++."

        "content1": "While I find backend development enjoyable, modern backends primarily focus on processing and returning data to clients. This reality sparked my interest in client-side development. I believe that writing client code has made me a better backend engineer, as I understand the challenges of working with undocumented or poorly designed APIs that only partially deliver the required data.",
        "content2": "Professionally, I have experience across a variety of platforms, including native mobile apps (iOS and Android), hybrid mobile apps, standard Electron apps, Electron apps with a local Go backend for heavy lifting (utilizing cgo for native Windows and macOS libraries), and Single Page Applications (SPAs) using Angular, React, and more."

It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine. —",
