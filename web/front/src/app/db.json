Over the years, I've explored various programming languages and technologies. I enjoy learning new concepts and often spend my free time experimenting with emerging tools and frameworks. I am dedicated to clean architecture and well-tested code.",

        "Like many web engineers from the pre-AngularJS era, I began my journey with backend development. I started with raw PHP when it was a leading technology for building websites, then embraced new trends such as Rails, Django, Symfony 2, Node, and Go. I strive to stay current with the evolution of backend technologies, carefully weighing their pros and cons before adopting them. Additionally, I have spent several years working with C and C++."

        "While I find backend development enjoyable, modern backends primarily focus on processing and returning data to clients. This reality sparked my interest in client-side development. I believe that writing client code has made me a better backend engineer, as I understand the challenges of working with undocumented or poorly designed APIs that only partially deliver the required data.",
        "Professionally, I have experience across a variety of platforms, including native mobile apps (iOS and Android), hybrid mobile apps, standard Electron apps, Electron apps with a local Go backend for heavy lifting (utilizing cgo for native Windows and macOS libraries), and Single Page Applications (SPAs) using Angular, React, and more."
